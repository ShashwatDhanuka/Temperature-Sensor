# Temperature-Sensor
To write the code for digital thermometer, we need to write the code for Arduino, LM35 Temperature Sensor, and 16x2 LCD module interfacing. First we include library for LCD unit and then we defines data and control pins for LCD and temperature sensor.  After getting analog value at analog pin we reads that value using Analog read function and stores that value in a variable. And then by applying given formula converts it in temperature.  float analog_value=analogRead(analog_pin);   float Temperature=analog_value*factor*100  where   factor=5/1023  analog_value= output of temperature sensor
